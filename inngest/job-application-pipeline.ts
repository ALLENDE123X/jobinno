/**
 * ACT-009 — the orchestration layer. Two Inngest functions, wired to the real
 * ACT-002 through ACT-008 modules.
 *
 *   1. discoverListings — ONE bulk search per request, runs once.
 *   2. applyToJob       — fans out from that single list. N listings = N
 *                         independent runs, at most 5 in flight (`concurrency`).
 *                         Each run is its own sequential chain internally
 *                         (account → maybe verify → fill+submit) because those
 *                         are causally dependent; every listing's chain runs in
 *                         parallel with every other listing's.
 *
 * ── Four things the original stub got wrong, and what replaced them ──────────
 *
 * **1. A live browser cannot be handed between steps.** The stub did
 * `const account = await step.run("create-account", …)` and then passed
 * `account.session` into a later `fill-application` step. Inngest's durable
 * execution can run those two steps in different invocations of this process —
 * that is the whole point of it — so `account.session` would arrive as a JSON
 * corpse of a Playwright page. This is exactly why ACT-012/007/008 were each
 * built as self-contained, re-entrant calls keyed only by a `job_applications`
 * row id: `createBoardAccount` takes strings and returns plain data,
 * `submitApplication` takes a row id and returns plain data, and neither has a
 * session in its signature at all. Nothing crosses a step boundary here but ids
 * and strings.
 *
 * **2. Filling and submitting are ONE step, not two.** `submitApplication()`
 * (ACT-008) already calls ACT-007's `fillApplicationFormRetainingSession()` and
 * submits in *the same browser* — see its "Why this calls ACT-007 rather than
 * resuming it" header. A separate `fill-application` step followed by a
 * `submit-application` step would open two browsers, fill the form in the first,
 * throw it away, and then ask the second to submit a form it never filled. So
 * there is one `fill-and-submit-application` step and it calls ACT-008 alone.
 *
 * **3. The verification wait is conditional.** The stub always waited for
 * `email/verification-received` before proceeding. Most Greenhouse listings are
 * direct-apply — ACT-012's whole design — and `createBoardAccount` reports that
 * as `no_account_required`, meaning there is no account, no signup mail, and
 * nothing to wait for. Waiting anyway would park the majority of real listings
 * on a ten-minute timeout for an email that is never sent. The wait is entered
 * on exactly one status, `awaiting_verification`, which is the only one that
 * means a signup was actually submitted.
 *
 * **4. Events carry a `candidateId`, not raw resume/LinkedIn/email strings.**
 * `candidates.resume_url` is a bucket-qualified path into a *private* bucket
 * (`resumes/{id}.pdf`), not a fetchable URL, and ACT-007 reads the object itself
 * with the service-role client rather than being handed a link. `linkedin_url`
 * and `application_email` live on the same row. So the events carry the row's
 * id and the one step that needs the email looks it up. The field is spelled
 * `candidateId` rather than the stub's `userId` because that is what it has to
 * be: see `verificationMatch` below.
 *
 * ── What this file does NOT do ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 * It never writes to `job_applications`. The stub had a `log-to-tracker` step
 * calling `updateTrackerRow`, and there is no table for it to write to: the
 * actinno project has exactly two tables, `candidates` and `job_applications`,
 * and every module in the chain already writes its own status to the latter as
 * it goes (`creating_account` → `no_account_required` / `awaiting_verification`
 * → `email_verified` → `filling_form` → `form_filled` → `submitted`). That row
 * *is* the tracker; a second writer would only ever disagree with it. The one
 * Supabase call in this file is a read of `candidates`.

 *    times out silently. `requireCandidateId` and `loadCandidate` between them
 *    make that fail at the start of the run instead.
 *
 *  · `async.data.company` is compared against the company string. ACT-006 reads
