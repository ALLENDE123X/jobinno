/**
 * ACT-007 — filling a job application form from the candidate's resume, and
 * stopping dead before it is submitted.
 *
 * Given nothing but a `job_applications` row id, this opens its own browser,
 * gets itself to the application form (completing the emailed verification and
 * signing in on the way, when the row needs that), types the candidate's data
 * into the fields it can positively identify, attaches the resume PDF, and
 * leaves the form sitting there filled. **It never submits.** Submission is
 * ACT-008; the handoff is `job_applications.status = "form_filled"`.
 *
 * ── The untrusted-text boundary ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Resume text, job-description text and application-question text are all
 * treated as hostile — the resume most of all, since a candidate's own resume
 * PDF was found earlier in this project's history to carry an embedded prompt
 * injection. The design puts a structural wall between "text we read" and
 * "things we can do", in three layers:
 *
 *  1. **Untrusted text never enters this module.** Parsing and cover-letter
 *     writing happen in `resume-parser.ts`, which has no browser and no tools —
 *     see its header. What crosses back is a `ResumeProfile` of validated,
 *     length-capped, structurally-checked strings.
 *
 *  2. **Every instruction an action-capable model reads is a compile-time
 *     constant.** All of them live in `INSTRUCTIONS` below. Nothing from the
 *     page, the resume, the job description or a question label is ever
 *     concatenated into one. `create-board-account.ts` still builds one act()
 *     instruction from a page-derived label; this module builds none.
 *
 *  3. **Values are arguments, never instructions.** Every write to the page is
 *     `typeInto()` (a structured `Action` whose `arguments` carry the value,
 *     which Stagehand executes without any inference at all — see that
 *     function's comment) or `locator.setInputFiles()` (no model in the path at
 *     all). A resume-derived string is never part of a prompt.
 *
 * Two things then check the result rather than trusting it: `describeControl()`
 * reads the target element's own name/id/label out of the DOM and refuses to
 * type into a control that does not describe itself as the field we meant, and
 * every filled field is read back out of the browser afterwards.
 *
 * ── ACT-015: unlimited field coverage, and better injection properties ──────
 * Layer 2 above had a cost nobody priced: a field nobody enumerated in advance
 * was structurally invisible. `INSTRUCTIONS` names first name, last name, email,
 * phone, LinkedIn, website, resume and cover letter, so a real Discord
 * Greenhouse form came back with a required country dropdown, a required essay,
 * three required work-authorization questions and four required EEO selects all
 * blank — a form the board's own validation would reject. That is a static
 * script with a model in the loop, not something that adapts to the form it
 * lands on.
 *
 * Dynamism and containment were never in tension; they had just been fused. The
 * field layer is now three separate things:
 *
 *  · **Perception** — `enumerateFormFields()` in `form-fields.ts` reads the DOM
 *    and reports *every* control: label, kind, required flag, current value, and
 *    the real option strings behind a dropdown. No model at all. Reading a page
 *    was never the dangerous part.
 *
 *  · **Decision** — `decideFieldAnswers()` in `resume-parser.ts`, one call with
 *    **no tools attached**, guarded by the same `assertNoActionSurface()` the
 *    resume parse and the cover letter already use. Untrusted form labels reach
 *    it, and the worst they can achieve is a wrong *string* in a JSON field,
 *    because the thing holding them cannot click, navigate, upload or submit.
 *
 *  · **Action** — `applyFieldValue()` in `form-fields.ts`, no model, no
 *    natural-language instruction: a `fill`, a `selectOption` or a `click` on an
 *    element addressed by a selector the perception pass computed. In particular
 *    no page-derived label is ever concatenated into an instruction, which is
 *    the residual risk earlier reviews flagged in ACT-005's apply-click; this
 *    layer does not reintroduce it.
 *
 * The net effect is strictly better than before: every value that reaches the
 * page must be either an option the DOM itself offers or a candidate fact this
 * system already validated, and `INSTRUCTIONS` is still the complete list of
 * sentences any action-capable model sees.
 *
 * ── The answering policy ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * These are legally meaningful statements made to a real employer under a real
 * person's name, so every field is categorised (`resolveDecision` below):
 *
 *  · **Answered from stored data** — work authorization, sponsorship, country,
 *    city, relocation — from the `candidates` columns ACT-015 added, collected
 *    once at intake. A value must trace to a named fact in a closed catalogue.
 *  · **Generated** — free-text essay questions ("Why do you want to work at
 *    Discord?"), which are a cover letter under another name and go through the
 *    same generator, fed the *validated profile*, never raw resume text.
 *  · **Declined** — every EEO/demographic question, always, by selecting its
 *    "decline to self-identify" option. Declining is truthful; inventing a
 *    demographic identity for a real person is not, and cannot happen here: the
 *    rule is a regex on the field's own label applied in TypeScript, not an
 *    instruction the model is trusted to follow.
 *  · **Never guessed** — anything factual with no backing data stops and asks.
 *    A model asserting "yes, authorized to work in the US" on someone's behalf
 *    is a material misrepresentation, and this is the single rule the rest of
 *    the design exists to make mechanical.
 *
 * When a required field cannot be answered truthfully the run does not guess and
 * does not silently skip: it returns `needsInput`, a structured list of what it
 * still needs, alongside everything it did fill. The caller asks the user, then
 * re-invokes with `additionalAnswers` and it finishes. That loop is stateless —
 * nothing is stored between the two calls, and the keys are derived from the
 * form's own labels so the second run recomputes them identically.
 *
 * ── Why this is one self-contained, re-entrant call ─────────────────────────
 * Inngest steps are independently retried and resumed, and a Playwright/Stagehand
 * page handle is not serialisable, so a browser cannot be carried from ACT-005's
 * step into this one. Everything this needs is therefore re-read from the row:
 * apply URL, board password, account-gate verdict, candidate. Verification and
 * form-fill are one call for the same reason in reverse — they must share a
 * cookie jar, so they cannot be two steps.
 *
 * ── What ACT-008 added, and why it is here rather than there ────────────────
 * That same reasoning applies once more between this module and submission: a
 * filled form only exists inside a live browser, so ACT-008 cannot pick up where
 * this leaves off unless the browser is still open. `fillApplicationForm()` on
 * its own always closes it — that is unchanged, and every existing caller keeps
 * exactly the behaviour it had. `fillApplicationFormRetainingSession()` is the
 * one door for `submit-application.ts` (ACT-008): identical flow, and on the
 * clean `form_filled` path only, the live `BrowserSession` is handed back for
 * the caller to close. The alternative was for ACT-008 to re-derive "which
 * control opens the form / which box is the email field / which button really
 * submits" against a real employer's site a second time, which is both a second
 * copy of every guard in this file and a second set of clicks on a live board.
 *
 * Three other things here are exported for ACT-008 rather than copied: the
 * `APPLICATION_CONTROL_RE` / `SUBMIT_WORD_RE` pair (ACT-008 requires exactly the
 * predicate this module refuses on — see `assertNotAnApplicationSubmit`),
 * `describeControl` (the DOM-truth read), and `ControlDescriptor.text`/`.role`,
 * which were added for it. **This module's own behaviour is unchanged by all of
 * it**: `corroborate()` still reads only `tag`, `type` and `haystack`, and
 * nothing here clicks anything that submits an application.
 *
 * Targets Jobinno's own Supabase project, guarded by the shared
 * `assertSupabaseProject()` check every module here imports.
