/**
 * ACT-006 — Gmail verification listener.
 *
 * ACT-005/ACT-012 (`create-board-account.ts`) submits a signup on a real
 * employer's job board and parks the row at
 * `job_applications.status = "awaiting_verification"`. Meanwhile the Inngest
 * run for that listing is asleep inside `step.waitForEvent("await-verification")`
 * (`inngest/job-application-pipeline.ts`). This module is the thing that wakes
 * it up: it polls one Gmail mailbox, finds the verification mail belonging to
 * that specific signup, pulls the code/link out of it, and sends
 * `email/verification-received`.
 *
 * ── The security boundary (read this before changing any matching rule) ──────
 * An agent that reads inbound email and then *acts* on what it says is a
 * phishing target by construction. Anyone who knows the mailbox address can put
 * a message in it; "looks like a confirmation email" is a filter an attacker
 * writes past in one line. So a message is only ever acted on when ALL of the
 * following hold:
 *
 *   1. **Sender domain.** The `From:` domain is the registrable domain of the
 *      board the agent itself navigated to (`job_applications.apply_url`), or a
 *      domain belonging to that board's ATS vendor (`ATS_SENDER_DOMAINS`).
 *      Nothing else. Not "a domain resembling the company name", not "a domain
 *      in the body".
 *   2. **Time window.** The message arrived no earlier than the signup and no
 *      later than `VERIFICATION_WINDOW_MS` after it, where the signup instant is
 *      `job_applications.updated_at` at the moment ACT-005 wrote
 *      `awaiting_verification`.
 *   3. **Intent.** Subject or body actually reads as a verification/confirmation
 *      request.
 *   4. **Extractable.** A code or an allowlisted verification link comes out of
 *      it. A link is only ever emitted if its own host is on the same sender
 *      allowlist, so a matched email cannot steer a later step to an arbitrary
 *      URL.
 *   5. **Unambiguous.** If two pending signups could both claim the same
 *      message — the ordinary case, since five concurrent Greenhouse
 *      applications all trust `greenhouse.io` — it is only attributed to one of
 *      them when the message itself names that employer. Otherwise it is
 *      dropped, loudly.
 *
 * Rules 1 and 2 are pushed into the Gmail query itself (`from:(...) after:...
 * before:...`) rather than applied after fetching everything, so the scope is
 * structural: an unscoped message is never even downloaded. They are then
 * re-checked in-process against the exact timestamps, because Gmail's own
 * `after:`/`before:` granularity is not contractually to-the-second.
 *
 * Every rule fails **closed**. A missed verification shows up as the Inngest
 * wait timing out after 10m (`verification_timeout`) — visible, recoverable,
 * and vastly preferable to acting on someone else's email.
 *
 * ── What this module does NOT do ────────────────────────────────────────────
 * It never writes to Supabase (read-only service-role queries), never mutates
 * the mailbox, and never opens a browser. Clicking the verification link and
 * moving the row past `awaiting_verification` belong to the steps downstream of
 * the Inngest wait, not here.

 * payload for the steps that run after the wait.
 *
 *  · `company` is `job_applications.company` read straight back out of the row

/**
 * ── The design decision this ticket had to make ──────────────────────────────
 *
 * "Sender domain must match the board" is not one rule, because on a hosted ATS
 * the board and the sender are different companies. `job-boards.greenhouse.io`
 * is Greenhouse's hostname, not the employer's, and the account-verification
 * mail for a Discord listing arrives from Greenhouse, not from discord.com.
 *
 * Two options were on the table:
 *
 *   (a) a known-ATS sender table, or
 *   (b) a looser "the apply URL's registrable domain OR any known ATS domain"
 *       rule.
 *
 * (b) was rejected: "any known ATS domain" means every pending signup trusts
 * every ATS vendor at once, so a Workday listing would accept mail from Lever.
 * What is implemented is (a) **keyed by the board actually visited** — the
 * allowlist for one row is that row's own apply-URL domain plus only the mail
 * domains of the one ATS that hosts it. A Greenhouse listing never trusts
 * Workday.
 *
 * Entries are restricted to domains the ATS vendor itself owns. Notably absent
 * are generic delivery and click-tracking domains (sendgrid.net, mailgun.org,
 * pstmrk.it, …): those are shared by the entire internet, and putting one here
 * would hand the boundary to anyone with a free ESP account.
 *
 * **Known limitation, deliberate:** many ATSs let an employer configure a
 * custom sending domain (Greenhouse in particular will send candidate mail as
 * `no-reply@<employer>.com`), and plenty of employers run careers pages on a
 * domain unrelated to their corporate mail domain. When that happens this
 * listener will not match, the Inngest wait will hit its 10m timeout, and the
 * row will read `verification_timeout`. That is the intended failure direction:
 * the alternative — inferring a trusted domain from the company *name* — is
 * precisely the unscoped guess this ticket forbids. The fix for a specific
 * employer is a one-line addition to the table below, made deliberately by a
 * human who knows that employer really does send from that domain.
 *
 * Keys are registrable domains of *board* hostnames; values are registrable
 * domains that board's mail may come from (subdomains of a listed value are
 * accepted — see `senderDomainAllowed`).

 * byte the one this module's header describes, with one deliberate difference,
 * called out because it is a loosening:
 *
 *   **`VERIFICATION_INTENT_RE` is not applied.** Greenhouse's security-code mail
 *   — subject "Security code for your application to Discord", body "Copy and
 *   paste this code into the security code field on your application: …" —
 *   contains none of "verify", "confirm", "activate" or "validate", so the
 *   intent check would reject the exact message this exists to read. The
 *   intent requirement is not dropped, it moves: `CODE_ANCHOR_RE` inside
 *   `extractVerification` only yields a code when the mail announces one in so
 *   many words, and a message that announces no code returns nothing here. The
 *   sender allowlist and the time window — the two rules that make this not a
 *   phishing surface — are untouched.

 * Read-only, like everything else in this file. Nothing is labelled, moved or
