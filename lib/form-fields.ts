/**
 * ACT-015 — perception and action for arbitrary application-form fields.
 *
 * ACT-007 could only fill fields somebody had enumerated in advance: its
 * `INSTRUCTIONS` object listed first name, last name, email, phone, LinkedIn,
 * website, resume and cover letter, and `buildFieldPlan` walked exactly that
 * list. Everything else on a real form — a country dropdown, "Why do you want to
 * work here?", three work-authorization questions, four EEO selects — was
 * structurally invisible, so a Discord Greenhouse form came out with nine
 * required fields blank and could not have passed the board's own validation.
 *
 * This module supplies the two halves of the fix that do **not** involve a
 * language model, and that is the whole point of it being a separate file:
 *
 *  1. **Perception** (`enumerateFormFields`, `harvestOptions`) — reads the DOM
 *     and reports every control on the page: its visible label, its kind, its
 *     required flag, whether it already holds a value, and for option-based
 *     controls the actual option strings a human would see. This is
 *     `document.querySelectorAll` and nothing else. There is no model in it, so
 *     there is nothing here for a hostile form label to influence.
 *
 *  2. **Action** (`applyFieldValue`) — puts one decided value into one control
 *     through Playwright-style locators derived from the perception pass, and
 *     reads it back. Typing a string, choosing a listed option and ticking a box
 *     are deterministic operations once you hold the element; none of them needs
 *     inference, and none of them is performed by handing page-derived text to
 *     something that can act on it.
 *
 * The **decision** half — which value belongs in which field — is deliberately
 * not here. It lives in `resume-parser.ts` (`decideFieldAnswers`), the module
 * that already owns the no-tools LLM path and `assertNoActionSurface()`. So the
 * three concerns that ACT-007 fused are three separate things again: reading a
 * page (this file, no model), deciding an answer (`resume-parser.ts`, a model
 * with no tools), and performing it (this file, no model).
 *
 * ── What "no natural-language instruction" means here ───────────────────────
 * `create-board-account.ts` builds one `act()` instruction from a page-derived
 * label, and earlier reviews flagged that as the residual injection risk in this
 * repo. Nothing in this file does that. Every write goes through
 * `page.locator(selector)` with a selector this module computed from the DOM
 * itself, and every value is passed as an argument to `fill` / `click` /
 * `selectOption`. A form label never becomes a sentence a model reads.
