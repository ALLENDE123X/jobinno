/**
 * ACT-003 — candidate intake: resume upload + `candidates` row.
 *
 * Targets the Supabase project named by `EXPECTED_SUPABASE_PROJECT_REF`, see
 * `.env.example`. JOB-002 moved that from a literal in this file into the
 * environment, and `assertSupabaseProject()` in `lib/supabase-project-guard.ts`
 * still makes pointing this code at any other project a hard failure rather
 * than a silent write. That matters because more than one live product shares
 * the Supabase account. The README's "meminno project" line is stale.
 *
 * Storage layout: bucket `resumes` (private), object key `{candidateId}.pdf`.
 * `candidates.resume_url` stores the bucket-qualified path
 * `resumes/{candidateId}.pdf` — NOT a fetchable URL. The bucket is private, so
 * downstream consumers must mint a signed URL from `bucket` + `objectPath`
 * (both returned here) rather than using `resume_url` directly.
 *
 * ACT-014 adds a second prefix to the same bucket, `resumes/staging/`, holding
 * presigned uploads that have not yet become anybody's resume. See the ACT-014
 * section at the bottom of this file for why it is a prefix and not a bucket,
 * and for how those objects are reclaimed.

 * through Claude Desktop ended with the user holding a bare UUID they had to
 * paste back for every apply. This is the same read keyed on
 * `application_email` instead, and it lives here rather than in the MCP server
 * for the reason given above `loadCandidate` — this module owns the
 * `candidates` table's conventions and the `assertSupabaseProject` guard, and a
 * second Supabase client elsewhere would be a copy of both.
 *
 * ── Why this can fail on a *successful* query ───────────────────────────────
 * `application_email` has **no unique constraint** (checked: `candidates` has
 * exactly one index, the primary key on `id`), and nothing stops intake being
 * run twice for the same address — an updated resume is the obvious way it
 * happens. So an email is a *hint* at an identity, not an identity. Two matches
 * means two different resumes, and picking the newer one would silently file
 * applications with a resume the user did not choose. It throws instead, naming
 * both ids so the caller can re-run with the `candidateId` it wants.
 *
 * ── Why the query is `ilike` and the comparison is not ──────────────────────
 * Users type `Jane@Example.com` for a row stored as `jane@example.com`, so the
 * match has to be case-insensitive, and PostgREST's only case-insensitive
 * operator is `ilike`. But `ilike` takes a *pattern*: `%`, `_` and `*` in the
 * value are wildcards, and `_` is common in real addresses (verified against
 * this project: `pranavlende12_@gmail.com` matches `pranavlende123@gmail.com`,
 * and backslash-escaping suppresses it). Escaping alone would make correctness
 * rest on PostgREST's escaping surviving a version bump — with a wrong
 * *candidate* as the failure — so the pattern is treated as nothing more than
 * a prefilter and every returned row is re-checked here by case-folded string
 * equality. Wildcards can then only ever cost an extra row, never resolve to
 * the wrong person.

// ACT-013 could only take a path, and the path had to be one Claude Desktop's
// Seatbelt sandbox would let the MCP server read — which in practice meant the
// user copying their PDF into `~/.actinno-mcp/resumes/` from a terminal before
// they could onboard at all. That is a terminal step in a product whose whole
// claim is that there isn't one.
//
// The bytes cannot come through the model either. ACT-013's header explains why
// at length and none of it has changed: base64 through a context window is tens
// of thousands of tokens the model has to reproduce byte-perfectly, and a PDF
// attached to a conversation reaches the model as extracted *text*, so it does
// not have the bytes to reproduce in the first place.
//
// So the bytes go around the model. `createResumeUploadSlot()` mints a Supabase
// **presigned upload URL** — a token scoped to one object path, valid two hours,
// carrying no credential of ours — and the model's own execution environment
// (analysis tool, VM, whatever it has) PUTs the attached file straight to
// Supabase over HTTPS. Nothing but a URL crosses the context window, and the
// service-role key stays in this process, where it belongs.
//
// ── The security consequence, stated plainly ───────────────────────────────
// A presigned URL is a write capability handed to something outside our trust
// boundary. Whatever ends up at that path is *untrusted input* — exactly as
// untrusted as a file path a user types, and arguably more so. It is therefore
// run through `assertUsableResumeBytes()`, the same function and the same three
// checks (non-empty, ≤25MB, `%PDF-` magic) that a local file gets, before it can
// become anyone's resume. There is no separate, laxer path for uploads.
//
// ── Why a prefix in `resumes` and not its own bucket ───────────────────────
// `resumes` already exists, is private, and is reachable only by service_role;
// a second bucket would be a second thing to provision, a second policy to keep
// in step, and a second name for `assertSupabaseProject` to have no opinion
// about. `staging/` inside it cannot collide with the real objects, which are
// `{uuid}.pdf` at the bucket root with no slash in the key, and it means the
// existing `cleanupOrphanedResume` shape works unchanged.
