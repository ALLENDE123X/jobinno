/**
 * ACT-008 — submitting the filled job application, and capturing whatever the
 * board says back.
 *
 * This is the one module in this repo that presses a button a real employer
 * receives. There is no undo, no draft state and no "cancel within 30 seconds";
 * the moment the click lands, a real person's name is on a real application at a
 * real company. Every unusual-looking decision below exists because of that
 * sentence, and the two rules the whole file is built around are:
 *
 *   1. **One logical submission, ever.** Until ACT-017 that was enforced as "one
 *      click", which was a proxy for it; Greenhouse broke the proxy by answering
 *      the click with "enter the 8-character code we just emailed you, then
 *      resubmit", so the rule is now enforced as written. There are exactly two
 *      `locator.click()` sites in this file and the second is reachable only
 *      from the branch where the first click **demonstrably submitted nothing**
 *      — form still on screen, same URL, no confirmation, a one-time code
 *      demanded. Neither is in a loop, neither has a retry, no catch leads back
 *      to either, there is no third, and no caller can ask for another attempt:
 *      a row whose status is already `submitted` or `submission_unconfirmed` is
 *      refused in `preflight()` before a browser is opened, and refused again by
 *      ACT-007's `READY_STATUSES` if it somehow got past that. The whole of that
 *      second leg is documented at `SecurityCodeReport`, above the code that
 *      does it.
 *
 *   2. **Nothing that happens at or after the click may produce a status that
 *      reads as safely retryable.** From the instant before the click, every
 *      exit goes through `unconfirmed()` → `submission_unconfirmed`, including a
 *      failure to write that very row. This is `create-board-account.ts`'s
 *      `blocked(..., neverThrow: true)` discipline, applied to a real
 *      application instead of a signup. Its comment there is worth re-reading:
 *      nothing observable from here distinguishes "the click never landed" from
 *      "the click landed and then the browser died", so the ambiguous case is
 *      treated as the dangerous one.
 *
 * ── Why this calls ACT-007 rather than resuming it ──────────────────────────
 * A filled form only exists inside a live browser, and a browser cannot cross a
 * process boundary — that is ACT-007's own documented reason for being one
 * self-contained call. So there is no "warm session" from an earlier run to pick
 * up, and the choice was between re-deriving the whole path to a filled form
 * here (a second copy of every guard in `fill-application-form.ts`, and a second
 * set of clicks on a live board) or composing with it in-process. This composes:
 * `fillApplicationFormRetainingSession()` runs ACT-007's flow unchanged and
 * hands back the still-open browser sitting on the filled form, and this module
 * then performs **exactly one further action** — the submit click — and reads
 * the result. ACT-009 gets to decide where the Inngest step boundary goes; it is
 * deliberately not decided here.
 *
 * ── The review gate ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The ticket calls the choice between full autonomy and a one-tap human review
 * gate, and answers it: full autonomy for the demo, with the swap-in point left
 * marked. That point is `input.approveSubmission`, defaulting to
 * `AUTO_APPROVE_SUBMISSION`, and it is called from exactly one place —
 * immediately before the point-of-no-return block. See both for the details.
 *
 * ── Untrusted text ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The confirmation wording this captures is page text, i.e. hostile input under
 * the rule the rest of this pipeline works to. It is read by `extract()` into a
 * fixed schema, sanitised, length-capped, and written to `confirmation_ref` and
 * to logs — it is never concatenated into an instruction, and the one
 * instruction a model gets from this module that can reach an action
 * (`INSTRUCTIONS.SUBMIT_APPLICATION`) is a compile-time constant.
 *
 * Targets Jobinno's own Supabase project, guarded by the shared
 * `assertSupabaseProject()` check every module here imports.

 * ══ THE APPROVAL-GATE SWAP-IN POINT ═════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * The default: submit immediately, no human in the loop. That is ACT-008's
 * declared design decision — full autonomy is the thing the demo exists to
 * prove — and this function is the entire implementation of it.
 *
 * To put a human back in the loop, **nothing in this file needs to change**.
 * Pass your own `approveSubmission` in `SubmitApplicationInput`; it is awaited
 * at exactly one call site (search this file for `approveSubmission` — there is
 * one), and it is awaited *after* the form is filled and the submit control has
 * been located and validated, but *before* the point-of-no-return block. So a
 * reviewer sees a real, filled form and the real button that is about to be
 * pressed, not a prediction of them. Declining is a clean, resumable state: the
 * row stays at `form_filled`, nothing is clicked, and re-running submits.
 *
 * For the Inngest wiring the ticket sketches (`step.waitForEvent`), that is:
 *
 *   await submitApplication({
 *     ...,
 *     approveSubmission: async (review) => {
 *       await step.sendEvent("ask", { name: "submission/review-requested", data: review });
 *       const ok = await step.waitForEvent("approve-submission", {
 *         event: "submission/approved", timeout: "1h",
 *         if: `async.data.jobApplicationId == "${review.jobApplicationId}"`,
 *       });
 *       return ok ? { approved: true, detail: "approved by a human" }
 *                 : { approved: false, detail: "review timed out" };
 *     },
 *   });
 *
 * One caveat for whoever does that, and it is the reason this hook is a
 * function rather than a boolean flag: the browser is **held open** across the
 * await. A gate that waits an hour holds a Chrome process and a logged-in
 * session for an hour, and boards expire sessions. A long-wait gate wants to be
 * a separate pass that re-runs the fill after approval, not a pause in the
 * middle of this one.

/**
 * ══ WHY THIS FILE NOW CONTAINS TWO CLICKS, AND WHY THAT IS STILL ONE SUBMISSION
 *
 * The rule this module was built around was "the submit control is clicked at
 * most once, ever". That rule was a proxy for the thing actually being
 * protected — **at most one application reaches the employer** — and on the
 * first real run against Discord's Greenhouse board the proxy and the thing came
 * apart. Greenhouse answered the click by *not* submitting: it re-rendered the
 * same form, at the same URL, with a banner reading "A verification code was
 * sent to … enter the 8-character code to confirm you're a human", an eight-box
 * Security code field, and a greyed-out Submit button. The mail that arrived
 * seconds later ended "After you enter the code, resubmit your application."
 *
 * A board whose own flow requires a second click is a board this module could
 * never submit to, and the run correctly recorded `submission_unconfirmed`
 * because it had no way to tell "rejected" from "accepted silently".
 *
 * So the invariant is restated, and the structure that enforces it changed with
 * it:
 *
 *   1. There are exactly two `locator.click()` sites in this file, and the
 *      second is reachable from **one** place: the branch taken when the read
 *      after the first click showed the form still on screen, at the same URL,
 *      with no confirmation of any kind — i.e. when the page itself says the
 *      first click submitted nothing — *and* both a model reading the page and a
 *      `document.querySelectorAll` sweep of it agree that a one-time code is
 *      being demanded. Every other post-click path still ends at
 *      `unconfirmed()`.
 *   2. There is no third. `submitClicks` is incremented before each click and
 *      checked before the second; there is no loop around either; and every exit
 *      below the second click is `unconfirmed()` or the success path.
 *   3. `submitAttempted` is still set before the *first* click and never
 *      cleared, so everything after it — including this whole code flow —
 *      remains incapable of producing a retryable status.
 *   4. Every failure in here (no mail, no code in the mail, no field to type it
 *      into, a field that will not take it, a Submit that stays disabled) stops
 *      at `submission_unconfirmed` with a reason. None of them clicks again.
 * ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

/**
 * How long to wait for the code mail before giving up.
 *
 * Short on purpose. A live Chrome is held open on a half-submitted application
 * for the whole of this, boards expire sessions, and the real mail arrived

 * mail may never come". If it expires, the run stops; it does not click again.
